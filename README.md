Wallet Watch is a React.js-powered expense tracking tool built entirely with React Hooks for state management. Users can input expenses, specifying amount, category, and date directly within the application. Utilizing pure JavaScript for graphical representation, Wallet Watch generates visual expense trends across months without external libraries. Its responsive design ensures accessibility across devices, while data persistence is maintained locally within the browser.
